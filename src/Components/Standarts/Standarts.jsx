            There are around 400 codes covering journalistic work around the
            world. While various codes may differ in the detail of their content
            and come from different cultural traditions, most share common
            elements including the principles of truthfulness, accuracy and
            fact-based communications, independence, objectivity, impartiality,
            fairness, respect for others and public accountability, as these
            apply to the gathering, editing and dissemination of newsworthy
            information to the public.
